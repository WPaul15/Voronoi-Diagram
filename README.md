# Voronoi-Diagram
## About
This is a project for COM S 418: Computational Geometry. Given any number of points, it will generate and display the Voronoi diagram of the points using Steven Fortune's line sweep algorithm. It will also generate and display the Delaunay triangulation of the set of site points using the Voronoi diagram.

## Input
The input file (`sites.txt` by default) must contain (x, y) coordinate pairs separated by either a space or a newline. The input file may also contain blank lines and comments can be added using the '#' character.
### Example
```
# Example Site Points

(2, -3) (-10, 9) (0, 0)
(-5, -2) (4, -7)
```
